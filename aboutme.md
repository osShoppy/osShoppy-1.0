Hello githubbers, welcome on my aboutme page!

What about me?

I just like to play with osCommerce.

What about osShoppy?

Starting osShoppy started about five years ago. I started my own webshop with osCommerce but after adding some
extensions i had mulltiple problems because i did not know what i was doing. After reading some books and many forums
i started to become more aware of what php java apache and all kind of codes meant.
After a second attempt of building an oscommerce webshop i had som server problems and couldn't get it right again.
After that moment i build osCommerce from scratch. All extensions are included in the project itself also. So after installing 
a fresh osCommerce System all extensions will be installed also. After adding the backup file the shop will be back online. This can all
be done in a view hours.
In two years it's become as it is now. Extended with more than a hundred extensions to install right from the start.
Because i wanted to share this on the internet i called it osShoppy and is it possible to download the zip file on the website.

I want to thank all osCommerce Community Builders for this wonderfull E-commerce System!
